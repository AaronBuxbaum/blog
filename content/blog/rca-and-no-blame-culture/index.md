Regardless of how polished your fundamentals are, it's inevitable that mistakes will happen. Much of what differentiates a productive and unproductive culture is the degree to which the lessons of those mistakes help inform future decisions. In my experience, the best way to make that change happen is through Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

As the name implies, the idea of RCA is to analyze the event and come to a conclusion about the "root cause", or the basis for the entire problem. Most problems aren't actually a result of a single event, but through appropriate analysis, your team can typically distill the problem down to a human error, a problem in process, or a lack of appropriate standards or discipline.

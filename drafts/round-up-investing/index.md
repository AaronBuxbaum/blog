A big trend over the last few years has been financial apps which watch for purchases on a credit card; when a purchase is made, it rounds up the remaining dollar amount and invests it for you. The theory here is that you're investing in the market in an automatic manner, and you get evenly distributed exposure to the market via the semi-uniform patterns of your purchases.

The issue with this system, though, is that it doesn't scale like you likely think it does. To explain why this is so, I'll use my own data as an example. I consider myself a reasonably rapid purchaser -- I have many subscriptions, buy takeout or delivery food daily, use Amazon very frequently for small purchases, and so on. Feel free to let me know if this matches your experience as well.

Across my three credit cards, over 2020 I had a total of 1154 transactions. To establish an absolute maximum amount of investment this could have generated over the year, we'll say each purchase ended in 0.01, meaning that every transaction rounded $0.99 into an investment account, and 1154 x 0.99=$1142. While this seems like a reasonable amount, first consider that it's much more likely that cent amounts are roughly evenly distributed; in that case we're looking at something more like 1154 x 0.5=$577.

Even if we do go by the absolute maximum possible investment, the results account for a little under $100/month. This is a very, very small percentage of the actual amounts spent on these credit purchases. My suspicion is that simply the psychological feeling of "investing" is likely to actually make you spend more than you'll invest in any given month, though I don't have any science to back that up.

Regardless, the problem is that 30

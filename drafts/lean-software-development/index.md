In the 1980s, Toyota revolutionized the automotive industry with a radical new approach: the Toyota Production System (TPS). Though the entire system is interesting from an industrial engineering perspective, the principles themselves (named [_The Toyota Way_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way)) are particularly transferrable into other disciplines, and as such are a great case-study of how to properly manage a software engineering team.

The Toyota Way is comprised of 14 principles, divided into four sections.

### Section 1: Long-Term Philosophy
1. Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.

### Section 2: The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results
2. Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.
3. Use "pull" systems to avoid overproduction.
4. Level out the workload (heijunka). (Work like the tortoise, not the hare).
5. Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time.
6. Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.
7. Use visual control so no problems are hidden.
8. Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.

### Section 3: Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People
9. Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.
10. Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.
11. Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.

### Section 4: Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning
12. Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation (genchi genbutsu).
13. Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options; implement decisions rapidly (nemawashi).
14. Become a learning organization through relentless reflection (hansei) and continuous improvement (kaizen).


While all of this makes sense, a few of the principles speak to me a bit more than others.
